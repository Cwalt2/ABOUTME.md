## üöÄ Project Experience

### Blue Team Member - SLU Brute Force Lions
* Selected for a competitive university team to train for and compete in the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 CyberForce Competition.
* Actively training in defensive cybersecurity tactics, including system hardening for Linux and Windows environments and network monitoring.
* Collaborating with teammates to research and develop defense strategies for securing Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and critical infrastructure.

### WarRunning - Personal Project
* Developed a Python-based Wi-Fi reconnaissance tool using Scapy to passively capture SSIDs, BSSIDs, encryption types, and signal strength.
* Applied practical knowledge of 802.11 protocols, wireless encryption (WEP, WPA2, WPA3), and network security principles.
* Implemented features for wireless network enumeration, enabling detection of secured vs. open networks and assessing basic wireless security posture.

### Homelab - Personal Project
* Mapped and assessed local network devices using Nmap to detect open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities.
* Configured firewall policies to detect and log suspicious activity, experimenting with alert thresholds and automated responses.
* Configured routers and switches in an isolated environment for network and endpoint security.
* Created a virtual environment configured to safely sandbox malicious files for malware analysis.

### MiniPilot - Computer Architecture Project
* Configured Debian linux to create a loT environment for hardware and AI development.
* Configured a headless environment with SSH and SCP access behind a VPN for secure data transmission.
* Used YoloV5n, Ultralytics with a PyTorch backend to successfully train a competent AI model to detect traffic indicators.
